Credit Grade Data Analysis & Web Service
========================================

Create a RESTful web service that returns a credit grade when fed data about an individual business. Credit grade is a
measure of credit quality with A1 being the highest and D5 being the lowest.

`sample_data.csv` is historical data on loans that have already been underwritten, including the final `credit_grade`
that was assigned to them. Use this historical data to inform the design of your new credit grading algorithm.
